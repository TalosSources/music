# Experiment with audio files and markdown

## First test
[[music.mp3]]

## Doesn't work. Maybe this?
<audio controls="controls">
  <source type="audio/mp3" src="/music.mp3"></source>
  <p>Your browser does not support the audio element.</p>
</audio>

## Ok something else
![music](https://github.com/TalosSources/music/raw/master/music.mp3)

## I think this works!
